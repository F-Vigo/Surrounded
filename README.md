# Surrounded

*Surrounded* is an arcade minigame where a player must face never ending waves of enemies moving in their direction.

When the player loses three lives, the game is over, and they can record their score for the leaderboard.

It has been developed with Python 3 and the Pygame library.

This repository comes with a .exe file made with pyinstaller, in the `dist` folder, so that you can play immediately!
